# Arcade Game

This project is an Arcade Game implemented in C++. The main logic resides in `main.cpp`, and additional modules or assets may be found in the `arcade/` directory.

## Features

- Modular code structure
- Easy to extend and modify

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Make (optional, if you use a Makefile)

### Build and Run

1. **Compile the game:**
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o arcade_game
   ```
   Or, if you have additional source files in the `arcade/` directory:

   g++ main.cpp arcade/*.cpp -o arcade_game
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```sh
   ./arcade_game
   ```
